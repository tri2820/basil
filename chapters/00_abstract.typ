Collaboration Platforms, such as Monday.com and ClickUp, have revolutionized enterprise workflow management, generating billions in revenue by integrating multiple functionalities into a unified platform. However, as organizations integrate more third-party apps, security concerns ariseâ€”particularly around data privacy, access control, and system integrity.

We present a sandbox solution with enhanced functionality while maintaining robust security. Our evaluation shows that the sandbox enables granular access control, broadens the technical capabilities of third-party apps and enhances the developer experience.

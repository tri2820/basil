Collaboration platforms, such as Monday.com and ClickUp, have revolutionized enterprise workflow management by integrating diverse functionalities into a single, unified platform. These platforms have generated billions in revenue, but their third-party app integrations are often constrained due to security concerns and the lack of a flexible sandbox model.

In this paper, we present a novel sandbox solution that enhances functionality while maintaining robust security. Our evaluation demonstrates that this sandbox model enables granular access control, expands the technical capabilities of third-party applications, and significantly improves the developer experience.

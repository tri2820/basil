Enterprise collaboration platforms, such as Monday.com#footnote[https://monday.com/] and ClickUp#footnote[https://clickup.com/], have generated billions in revenue by addressing the data silos problem and integrating a broad range of functionalities into a single, unified platform. However, third-party app integrations are often limited due to the absence of a flexible sandbox model. In this paper, we propose a novel sandbox solution based on Secure EcmaScript and the Membrane programming pattern. Our evaluation demonstrates how this sandbox model expands the technical capabilities of third-party applications and improves the developer experience, all while not sacrificing security. We conclude that this sandbox model provides a viable solution for building more effective enterprise collaboration platforms.
